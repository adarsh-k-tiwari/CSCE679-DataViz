## Level 1

In this task, you need to draw a **Matrix View** to visualize the **Monthly Temperature** of Hong Kong, where the color of each matrix cell encodes the temperature. You can find the data in [temperature_daily.csv](./temperature_daily.csv).

---

## Level 2
In this task, you need to **improve** the previous visualization by showing the **daily changes of temperature** as well. You only need to focus on the last 5 to 10 years of data.
